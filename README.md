# Mystic Match

Mystic Match is a fantasy inspired card matching game. The purpose of Mystic Match is to match all the pairs of cards as quickly as possible and in as few moves as possible.
Mystic Match was inspired by all things 'cottage-core'. This then evolved into fantasy cottage-core vibes primarily targeted at players who want a 'cosy' matching game, with a love for all things fantasy or folk you would meet during a Live-Action Role-Playing Game.

## Target Audience
     the target audience for this project was mainly for anyone and everyone whether users like the idea of mythical creatures or just want a memory game to play, I'd hope that this is what they would be looking for.

## User Experience
     as a user, I would like to play a memory game which purely tests your memory based on where images are located in a grid on the page. 

     as a user who enjoys fantasy and mythical creatures, I wanted a game that would match that aesthetic. 

     as a user, I would like the game to be intuitive and straight forward to learn.

     as a user, I want immediate feedback from matched cards such as those that are matched not flipping back.

## Design Choices, Features, Typography and WireFrames

     For this project, the design process was fairly straightforward to me, I wanted to show my passion for all things fantasy. Overall the design of this project remains the same across all screen sizes and is fully responsive.

### Typography
     For this project, the typography used for Mystic Match is Cinzel Decorative, serif font. I wanted something with a little extra flare yet still be readable.

### Features
     Cards randomize every time the player refreshes the page.
     Layout remains fairly similar across all devices due to responsivity.
     Mystic Match has overlays which control the 'play-game' functions, 'winner' functions and 'game-over' functions.
     this game has a countdown timer and has a matches tracker. 
     once the player has matched all cards on the board, they get an automatic winner overlay appear.

## Deployment

     Project-Portfolio-2 was deployed to Github pages. 

     The steps I took to do this are as follows below: 
     
     In the GitHub repository, I clicked on the "Settings" tab.
     
     I then navigated to the "Pages" tab on the left-hand sidebar.
     
     Under "Source" click the "None" dropdown and selected the "main" or "master" branch.
     Clicked "Save".

Once the master branch had been selected and the browser has reloaded itself, the page then provided the link to the live deployed version of the website.

     The live link can be found here - Portfolio-Project-2 (https://beebeebethc.github.io/Portfolio-Project-2/).
