# Mystic Match

Mystic Match is a fantasy inspired card matching game. The purpose of Mystic Match is to match all the pairs of cards as quickly as possible and in as few moves as possible.
Mystic Match was inspired by all things 'cottage-core'. This then evolved into fantasy cottage-core vibes primarily targeted at players who want a 'cosy' matching game, with a love for all things fantasy or folk you would meet during a Live-Action Role-Playing Game.

## Target Audience
the target audience for this project was mainly for anyone and everyone whether users like the idea of mythical creatures or just want a memory game to play, I'd hope that this is what they would be looking for.

## User Experience
as a user, I would like to play a memory game which purely tests your memory based on where images are located in a grid on the page. 

as a user who enjoys fantasy and mythical creatures, I wanted a game that would match that aesthetic. 

as a user, I would like the game to be intuitive and straight forward to learn.

as a user, I want immediate feedback from matched cards such as those that are matched not flipping back.

## Design Choices, Features, Typography and WireFrames

For this project, the design process was fairly straightforward to me, I wanted to show my passion for all things fantasy. Overall the design of this project remains the same across all screen sizes and is fully responsive.

colours for this project are as follows: 

![colour-palette](assets/documentation-screenshots/colour-palette.png)

I chose these colours because when I think Fantasy, I think Purples, Mauves, Violets and felt these colours all complemented one another without causing contrast issues. The darkest colour I used for the main background colour, the other three colours mentioned I used as a gradient background for the game area.

### Typography
For this project, the typography used for Mystic Match is Cinzel Decorative, serif font. I wanted something with a little extra flare yet still be readable.

### Favicon image

### Features
Cards randomize every time the player refreshes the page.
Layout remains fairly similar across all devices due to responsivity.
Mystic Match has overlays which control the 'play-game' functions, 'winner' functions and 'game-over' functions.
this game has a countdown timer and has a matches tracker. 
once the player has matched all cards on the board, they get an automatic winner overlay appear.

### Wireframes

### Future Implementations

- levelling system i.e various levels easy / medium / hard incrementing from a 4 by 4 grid to a 6 by 6 grid for example
- Background Audio and sound effects for example a backing track with user controls and sound effects on card flips and overlays. 
- having images stored in a json document and getting them from that document into the game.

## Testing

Testing for Mystic Match can be found in the adjacent TESTING.md document.

## Deployment

Project-Portfolio-2 was deployed to Github pages. 

The steps I took to do this are as follows below: 
     
In the GitHub repository, I clicked on the "Settings" tab.
     
I then navigated to the "Pages" tab on the left-hand sidebar.
     
Under "Source" click the "None" dropdown and selected the "main" or "master" branch.

Clicked "Save".

Once the master branch had been selected and the browser has reloaded itself, the page then provided the link to the live deployed version of the website.

The live link can be found here - Portfolio-Project-2 (https://beebeebethc.github.io/Portfolio-Project-2/).

  ### How to clone the repository

For local development, If you wish to explore the making of Portfolio-Project-2, "Mystic Match", follow these steps below to create a clone:

     3. On the dropdown menu that appears once clicked, select the 'copy URL to clipboard' button (looks like two squares overlaying one another).
    
     4. Open your code editor, (for myself it's Visual Studio Code). On Visual Studio Code, Click the 'Source Control' button from the left hand side of the screen (the one that can also be   used to commit changes).
      - 4a. On alternative code editors,open the terminal and change the working directory to the location of your cloned repository. 
     5. Paste the repository URL into the top navigation bar of Visual Studio Code.
      - 5a. On alternative code editors, type 'git clone' into the terminal and paste the link of the URL
    
     6. Save the Repository to a localised folder where the repository will be stored on your computer.
    
     7. Click on select Repository location. 
    
     8. Let the Repository download and click 'open' when the onscreen prompt appears in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.

   ### Authors Final Word

   On reflection of the project, This project has been a steep learning curve into the world of JavaScript and honestly, I've really enjoyed it. Despite the frustrations and despite errors occuring and re-occuring (default image I'm looking at you!) I'm happy where this project is at point of submission. I hope you also enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed creating it.
